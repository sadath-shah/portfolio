      <h2>Student Registration System</h2>
      <p>
        The Student Registration System is a complete web-based application
        created to manage student data in a structured and user-friendly way. It
        is primarily designed using PHP and MySQL for the backend, while the
        frontend uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to ensure a
        responsive and modern user interface. When a student visits the
        registration page, they are presented with a clean form layout where
        they can enter their details such as first name, last name, email,
        contact number, course, and upload a profile picture. This form includes
        client-side validation using HTML5 and JavaScript to ensure all fields
        are filled out correctly before submission. Once the form is submitted,
        the data is sent to the backend PHP script. Here, server-side validation
        is performed for extra security, checking for things like duplicate
        entries and ensuring proper formatting. The password provided by the
        student is hashed using PHP’s password hashing functions before it is
        stored in the database. This ensures that even if the database were
        compromised, raw passwords would not be exposed. The uploaded profile
        image is saved in a specific folder on the server, and its file path is
        recorded in the MySQL database alongside the student’s other
        information. This allows the application to retrieve and display each
        student's profile image when viewing records. For administration, there
        is a separate login-protected admin panel. After logging in, the admin
        can access a dashboard that displays all registered students in a table
        format. The admin can perform several actions from this dashboard: View
        complete student profiles, including profile pictures. Edit student
        information, with forms pre-filled with existing data for easy updates.
        Delete student records permanently if needed. The admin dashboard is
        also styled using Bootstrap, providing responsive table layouts and form
        designs that look good on both desktop and mobile devices. Overall, this
        system is built with practical backend development concepts in mind:
        session management for admin login, database CRUD operations (Create,
        Read, Update, Delete), secure password storage, image handling, and
        responsive UI design. It serves as a solid example of a full-stack PHP
        and MySQL project suitable for real-world educational institutions or as
        a portfolio project for backend developers.
